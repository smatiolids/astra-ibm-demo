    "\n",
    "In addition to using the Langflow interface directly, you can execute your flow programmatically through an API call. This is useful for integrating Langflow functionality into your applications or automating the process. Here's how you can do it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Access API Settings**:\n",
    "   - First, navigate to the **Publish** option at the top right of the Langflow screen.\n",
    "   - In the dropdown menu, select **API Access**. This will allow you to access the settings necessary for generating an API token.\n",
    "\n",
    "   <img src=\"img/lf_rag14.png\" alt=\"Langflow\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "   You will then see the **API Access** screen, which provides you with the necessary details to generate your API token and the URL required to make the API call.\n",
    "\n",
    "   <img src=\"img/lf_rag15.png\" alt=\"Langflow\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Generate a Token**:\n",
    "   - The **API Token** is a security measure that authenticates your API calls. To generate the token:\n",
    "     - Click the button that generates the token (usually labeled \"Generate Token\").\n",
    "     - Once the token is generated, **copy it** and save it securely.\n",
    "\n",
    "   You will need to store this token in your **.env** file (a configuration file that stores environment variables). This is important because it prevents exposing sensitive information in your code. Your **.env** file will look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   LANGFLOW_API_TOKEN=\"AstraCS:...\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This token allows you to authenticate your requests when you call the Langflow API.\n",
    "\n",
    "   <img src=\"img/lf_rag16.png\" alt=\"Langflow\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Save the URL**:\n",
    "   - You also need the **API URL** to make API calls to Langflow. This URL is provided in the API Access section along with the token.\n",
    "   - As with the token, save the URL to your **.env** file:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   LANGFLOW_URL=\"AstraCS:...\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   The **LANGFLOW_URL** is the endpoint that your API calls will target. You will use this URL in conjunction with your API token to send requests to Langflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Making API Calls**:\n",
    "   - With the **LANGFLOW_API_TOKEN** and **LANGFLOW_URL** stored in your **.env** file, you can now use these credentials to make API calls to execute your Langflow in the next cell. "
