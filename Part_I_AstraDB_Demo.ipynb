    "# Why Astra DB\n",
    "\n",
    "### Low Latency / High Throughput\n",
    "\n",
    "Applications that need to write thousands of records per second or read data within milliseconds — even across multiple terabytes — benefit from Cassandra’s data model, which is intentionally optimized for high-performance reads and writes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### High Availability\n",
    "\n",
    "Applications that cannot afford downtime require data replication across multiple data centers. Every Astra DB instance automatically runs across three availability zones within a cloud region, achieving 99.99% uptime. Optionally, databases can span two (or more) regions, further increasing availability to 99.999%. This replication happens automatically without requiring changes to the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Massive Storage with Linear Scalability\n",
    "\n",
    "Astra DB can store terabytes of data while maintaining consistent read and write performance. Thanks to intelligent data partitioning, records are organized in a way that allows Cassandra to scale linearly and efficiently, even as data volume grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Astra DB\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the Apache Cassandra features, by running applications on DataStax Astra, the companies will also have additional benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reduced Operational Overhead\n",
    "\n",
    "Astra DB is a fully managed service that alleviates the need for teams to perform operational tasks such as server management, scaling, or maintenance. This allows developers to focus on building features rather than managing the database infrastructure, enhancing productivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multi-Cloud Flexibility\n",
    "\n",
    "Astra DB supports deployment across multiple cloud environments, providing businesses with the flexibility to operate in a hybrid or multi-cloud strategy. This flexibility enhances disaster recovery and ensures better performance based on geographic demands. Currently, users can create databases on AWS, MIcrosoft Azure and GCP in pultiple regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Enhanced Security and Compliance\n",
    "\n",
    "With built-in security features and compliance with industry standards (including HIPAA for healthcare and PCI for banking), Astra DB provides a secure environment for managing sensitive data, which is critical for regulated industries.\n",
